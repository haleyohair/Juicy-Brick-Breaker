# Project 3, Part 1â€”Assets and Particles
9/28/23
A crazy breakout game


## Implementation

I included different themes, icons, and particles. When the ball hits the paddle, hearts come out of it. When the ball hits a brick, balls come out of it. I changed the color of the bricks and took some out in the first level.
